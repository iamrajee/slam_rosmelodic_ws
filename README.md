The below codebase is a ROS melodic workspace that contains a variety of packages for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Workspace is for testing various SLAM methods(Gmapping, Karto, Hector, Cartographer etc).The codebase is well-organized and easy to use. It includes a number of tutorials that provide instructions on how to use the SLAM packages. The codebase is a valuable resource for anyone who wants to learn about SLAM or who wants to use SLAM in their own projects.

## Installation

> All the `code` required to get started
- #### Prerequisite
    - You should have ROS melodic on your ubuntu 18.04.
    - All ROS dependency is satisfied.

- #### Clone

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/iamrajee/slam_rosmelodic_ws.git
    ```

    ```
    cd slam_rosmelodic_ws/
    ./refresh.sh
    make
    ```

## Package description
* ## [test_slam](src/test_slam)
    
    ### Mapping
    > To do mapping run slam.launch file along with telop. Also, you can which slam_method to use among [Gmapping, Karto, Hector, Cartographer].
    ##### Run
    
    ```
    Terminal 1: roslaunch test_slam slam.launch slam_method:=gmapping          #here gmapping is default
    ```
    ```
    Terminal 2: roslaunch test_slam teleop.launch
    ```

    ### Navigation
    > After mapping you can run navigation by running navigation.launch file.
    ##### Run
    
    ```
    Terminal: roslaunch test_slam navigation.launch
    ```

Here are some details about the packages in the codebase:
gmapping: gmapping is a 2D SLAM package that uses a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter. It is a popular choice for SLAM applications that require low computational resources.
hector_slam: Hector_slam is a 2D SLAM package that uses a Hector laser scanner odometry and mapping algorithm. It is a good choice for SLAM applications that use a laser scanner.
slam_gmapping: slam_gmapping is a 2D SLAM package that combines the gmapping and Hector SLAM packages. It is a good choice for SLAM applications that require the best of both worlds.
cartographer: cartographer is a 3D SLAM package that uses a probabilistic graph SLAM algorithm. It is a good choice for SLAM applications that require high accuracy and robustness.
loam_livox: loam_livox is a 3D SLAM package that uses a LiDAR odometry and mapping algorithm. It is a good choice for SLAM applications that use a LiDAR sensor.

The codebase also includes a number of other packages that are used to support the SLAM packages, such as:
tf: A package that provides a transformation framework for ROS.
nav_msgs: A package that provides messages for navigation.
sensor_msgs: A package that provides messages for sensor data.

    SHELL=/bin/bash
    all:
        make run
    run:
        catkin_make
        bash refresh.sh
    ```
    > It will build the workspace . Run it as `make`

* ## createpkg.sh
    ```

* ## tftree.sh
    ```
    #!/bin/bash
    rosrun rqt_tf_tree rqt_tf_tree
    ```
    > It will  launch the gui to visvualise the tf tree. Run it as `./tftree.sh`

* ## printenv.sh
    ```
    #!/bin/bash
    printenv | grep -i ROS
    ```
    > It will print the ROS related environment variable . Run it as `./printenv.sh`

* ## rosdep.sh
    ```
    sudo rosdep install -i --from-path src --rosdistro $ROS_DISTRO -y
    ```
    > It will install dependencies of all pkg in the workspace. Run it in the workspace as `./rosdep.sh`

* ## ssh_into_another_computer.sh
    ```
    #!/bin/bash
    ssh rajendra@rajendra
    ```
    > It will ssh into another system. Useful when using multiple ros masters. Run it as `./rajendra.sh`
